        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 slices Texas toast , or thick sliced sandwich bread</li>
                <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>4 slices medium cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>4 slices Gouda cheese</li>
                <li>4 slices Havarti cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices of bread in the skillet with the butter-side-down.</li>
                <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda. Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with the crisp sides on the outside.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on medium low for the breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and adhere to the bread.</li>
                <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.</li>
            </ol>
