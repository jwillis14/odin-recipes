        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Created in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York (during the 1800’s), the original recipe was made up of only apples, celery, and mayo. This simple combo lived on for quite some time. But as usual, adaptations are made as time goes on.</p>
            <p>Here’s the breakdown of what’s in this Waldorf salad recipe.</p>
